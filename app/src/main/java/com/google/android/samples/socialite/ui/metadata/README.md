# ℹ️ Metadata Inspector Module

This module adds a video metadata inspection feature to the Timeline/Chat screen. A small **(i)** info button appears on video thumbnails, and clicking it fetches and displays the video's metadata.

## Purpose

This feature serves as a practical demonstration of the `MetadataRetriever` and `MediaExtractorCompat` classes, showcasing their usage as they are migrated from the Android platform to the **Media3 library**.
