# SociaLite: An Android Sample App

SociaLite demonstrates how to use various Android platform APIs to implement features that
are commonly seen in social network apps, leveraging a variety of
[Jetpack APIs](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/getting-started) to achieve complex
functionality that works reliably on more devices and requires less code. These are some of the
Jetpack APIs used:

 - [Core](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/core) Notifications and other platform features
 - [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose) Declarative UI generation
 - [Media3](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/media3) Displaying and editing photos and videos
 - [CameraX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/camera) Capturing photos and videos
 - [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) Persisting messages in a SQLite database
 - [Window](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/window) Detecting foldable device states

> ðŸš§ **Work-in-Progress:** This sample is still in the early stage of development, and we're excited to add more features over time.

## App Overview

The main interaction in SociaLite centers around the animal avatars and their associated chat
threads. When you send a message to one of these avatars, they will respond in 5 seconds. If you
close the app within that time and you've granted notification permissions, you'll see a
notification for that reply.

Here are the screens that make up SociaLite:

 - *Timeline Screen:* A vertical scrolling page of all of the photos and videos sent in chats.
 - *Chat List Screen:* A list of all the chat threads with a variety of animal personalities.
 - *Chat Screen:* An individual message thread where you can send text and media
    messages (from the in-app camera or with a
    [Photo Picker](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/photopicker)).
 - *Camera Screen:* Clicking the camera icon in the Chat Screen opens the in-app camera for taking photos and videos.
 - *Video Edit Screen:* After taking a video with the in-app camera, users can do some minor edits on this screen.
 - *Settings Screen:* A basic settings screen for tasks like resetting the chat history.

## Reporting Issues

You can report an [issue with a sample](https://github.com/android/social-sample/issues) using
this repository. When doing so, make sure to specify which sample you are referring to.

## Troubleshooting

### Error running gradlew command on WSL

```shell
./gradlew spotlessApply

/usr/bin/env: â€˜sh\râ€™: No such file or directory
```

This may be due to issues with the `gradlew` file's line ending characters. Try converting the file's line endings to CRLF or LF as required by your operating system.
