# SociaLite: An Android Sample App

SociaLite demonstrates how to use various Android platform APIs to implement features that
are commonly seen in social network apps, leveraging a variety of
[Jetpack APIs](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/getting-started) to achieve complex
functionality that works reliably on more devices and requires less code. These are some of the
Jetpack APIs used:

 - [Core](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/core) Notifications and other platform features
 - [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose) Declarative UI generation
 - [Media3](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/media3) Displaying and editing photos and videos
 - [CameraX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/camera) Capturing photos and videos
 - [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) Persisting messages in a SQLite database
 - [Window](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/window) Detecting foldable device states

The app also integrates the Gemini API that powers chatbot capabilities:

 - [Google AI Client SDK](https://developer.android.com/ai/google-ai-client-sdk) Generative AI with Gemini 1.5 Flash


> ðŸš§ **Work-in-Progress:** This sample is still in the early stage of development, and we're excited to add more features over time.

## App Overview

![Screenshots of SociaLite showing the Timeline Screen, the Chat List Screen, and the Chat Screen](docs/images/screenshots.png "SociaLite screenshots")

The main interaction in SociaLite centers around the animal avatars and their associated chat
threads. When you send a message to one of these avatars, they will respond in 5 seconds. If you
close the app within that time and you've granted notification permissions, you'll see a
notification for that reply.

Here are the screens that make up SociaLite:

 - *Timeline Screen:* A vertical scrolling page of all of the photos and videos sent in chats.
 - *Chat List Screen:* A list of all the chat threads with a variety of animal personalities.
 - *Chat Screen:* An individual message thread where you can send text and media
    messages (from the in-app camera or with a
    [Photo Picker](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/photopicker)).
 - *Camera Screen:* Clicking the camera icon in the Chat Screen opens the in-app camera for taking photos and videos.
 - *Video Edit Screen:* After taking a video with the in-app camera, users can do some minor edits on this screen.
 - *Settings Screen:* A basic settings screen for tasks like resetting the chat history.

## How to run SociaLite

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the whole project in Android Studio.
3. Sync & Run `app` configuration

### (optional) Add Gemini API via Firebase AI Logic:
4. Set up a Firebase Project, connect your app to the _Gemini Developer API_ by following [these steps](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ai-logic/get-started?platform=android&api=dev),
5. Replace google-services.json with your own & Run `app` configuration,
6. In the app, go to Settings and tap the "AI Chatbot" button.
